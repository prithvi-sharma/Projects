<img src = "https://github.com/prithvi-sharma/Projects/blob/master/Piyu%20-%20Assembly%20Language%20Game/Images/Main%20Page.jpg">
<strong>This is my MPI - Micro-Processor and Interfacing subject project.</strong>
The legendary "Pac-Man" was written in Assembly language so I wanted to make something like that but in a simpler and feasible manner hence me and my team made this game.
