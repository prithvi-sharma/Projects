The best part about programming is that you can enbound your weirdest ideas into simple logics which would actually work. One the best thing is a game.

So, me and my friend took the game of 'Tic Tac Toe' and applied simple Perumtations and Combinations on it. We wanted to try how good can be python used in visuals of the games and cam a simple game be build with solo python script.
